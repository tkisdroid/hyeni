## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Pre-Phase 0 hygiene promoted to Phase 1 (no REQ-IDs) to establish `down/` migrations, drift reconciliation, env snapshots before any live-data change.
- Roadmap: Phase 5 Stream B (P2-8 remote listen) merges LAST behind a remote feature flag — highest Play Store policy risk.
- Roadmap: Phase 4 (memo unification) DoD is "shadow-running with 14-day read-parity," not "legacy dropped." `memos` DROP scheduled for v1.1.
- Roadmap: SOS-01 (`sos_events` immutable audit log) added as v1 scope expansion from research (PIPA + OWASP MASTG).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Pre-Phase 1 artifacts needed from user** (surfaced by research, to be confirmed during Phase 1 planning):
  - Production VAPID key backup location (for snapshot before any env-var change).
  - `@capacitor/push-notifications@8.x` install status in `package.json`.
  - Product-owner ACK that `memos` VIEW persists through v1.1 (Phase 4 DoD).
  - Remote feature-flag mechanism choice for Phase 5 Stream B (`family_subscription` column vs new `runtime_flags` table vs session flag).
